SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It’s the language of choice on today’s web for storing,
manipulating and retrieving data within relational databases. Most, if not all of the websites you visit
will use it in some way.
Using SQL, you are able to interact with the database by writing queries, which when executed,
return any results which meet its criteria.
